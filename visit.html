                you
                want. We have a lot of manure to be moved and weeding to be done!</p>

            <h4>BUS</h4>
            <p>From Dharamsala Bus Stand (the one in Dharamsala, not McLeodGanj) ask for a bus towards Chari (pronounced
                chuh-ree). Then tell the conductor you are going to Dhanotu (duh-no-too). If you see the Home Guard
                place on
                your right, you have gone too far! You can exit the bus there and walk back a few minutes to Dhanotu bus
                stop
                next to the sheetla mata temple.
                <br> <br>
                When you get off the bus, take the first road to the left (away from the big cliff overlooking the
                river).
                Follow the road and look for a gate with Hanuman Ji painted on it. That is us! If you have any problems
                you can
                contact us or just ask anyone for the "animal place".
            </p>

            <h4>CAR or Taxi</h4>
            <p>
                From Dharamsala Bus Stand (the one in Dharamsala, not McLeodGanj) take the road downhill towards Gharoh.
                Keep
                driving downhill (past Gharoh and Chari) to the Dhanotu bus stop.
                <br> <br>
                When you get off the bus, take the first road to the left (away from the big cliff overlooking the
                river).

            <h4>Plane</h4>
            <p>
                From Gaggal airport take a bus or taxi towards Chambi Pul. At the intersection in Chambi, turn right (do
                not
                cross
                the bridge). If you are taking the bus, get down at Chambi and take a bus uphill towards Chari.
                <br> <br>
                Continue uphill past the Home Guard center. When you see the Dhanotu bus stop on the left (next to the
                sheetla
                mata
                temple) turn right. Follow the road and look for a gate with Hanuman Ji painted on it. That is us! If
                you have
                any
                problems you can contact us or just ask anyone for the "animal place".

                From the train station in Pathankot, take a taxi towards Dharamsala. You will pass Shahpur and then
                Rait, then after
                you cross the next bridge (at Chambi) take the immediate left to go uphill.
                <br> <br>

                temple) turn right. Follow the road and look for a gate with Hanuman Ji painted on it. That is us! If
                you have any
