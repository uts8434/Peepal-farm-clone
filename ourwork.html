            <h1>What we do every day</h1>
            <h3><a href="">Stray Animal Rescue & Recovery</a></h3>
            <p>Leading by example is one of the best ways to cultivate compassion. Even though our rescue and recovery
                center
                has a short sighted goal, its impact reaches far beyond the recipient animals.
            </p>
            <h3><a href="">Awareness</a></h3>
            <p>We use storytelling to make people - who believe they are good - aware of the gap between their values,
                and their
                actions. Not to make people do what we want, but to nudge them in doing what they value.
            </p>
            <h3><a href="">Education</a></h3>
            <p>To get kids interested in social and emotional skills - also referred to as 'soft skills' - including
                empathy,
                leadership, communication, Peepal Farm has launched a cartoon series aligned with the National Education
                Policy.
            </p>
            <h3><a href="">Community</a></h3>
            <p>Animal welfare community in India is very fragmented. Without a community, people can feel very isolated.
                Our
                Facebook and WhatsApp groups help people connect with other animal lovers, online and locally.
            </p>
            <h3><a href="">Social Enterprise: Peepal Farm Products</a></h3>
            <p> Started out as an awareness effort, Peepal Farm Products has become a project that empowers local women
                through
                employment. All the profits (after taxes) are donated to our clinic.</p>
